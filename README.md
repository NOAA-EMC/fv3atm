# fv3atm

This repository contains a driver and key subcomponents of the
atmospheric component of the NOAA's [Unified Forecast System
(UFS)](https://ufscommunity.org/) weather model.

The subcomponents include:

 - The Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) dynamical core, originally
from the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/).
 - The Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) supported by the
   [Developmental Testbed Center
   (DTC)](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp),
   including:
   - [CCPP Framework](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework).
   - [CCPP Physics](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics)
 - wrapper code to call [UFS stochastic
   physics](https://stochastic-physics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - The io code handles netCDF I/O.
 - The cpl coupler code connects the different components and allows
   them to communicate.

## Prerequisites

This package requires the following
[NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) packages:
 - [NCEPLIBS-w3nco](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3nco)
 - [NCEPLIBS-w3emc](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc)
 - [NCEPLIBS-bacio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-bacio)
 - [NCEPLIBS-nemsio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-nemsio)
 - [NCEPLIBS-sp](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sp)

If the INLINE_POST cmake variable is set, the upp library will be
needed:
 - [Unified Post Processing Library](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/EMC_post)

This package also requires the following external packages:
 - [netcdf-c Library](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c)
 - [netcdf-fortran Library](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran)
 - [ESMF](https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf)
 - [GFDL's Flexible Modeling System](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS)

## Obtaining fv3atm

To obtain fv3atm, clone the git repository, and update the submodules:

```
