# This file is used in the CI to define the libraries needed to build fv3atm. It
# is used by the 'spack env create' command to generate a Spack environment. It
# is generally preferred to avoid defining settings here that are not shared
# across CI workflows, such as requiring the use of a specific compiler. Any
# such modifications should be done in the appropriate CI workflow using the
# 'spack config add' command, or with search-and-replace.
# WARNING: Changing this file will automatically cause the cached Spack builds
# in GitHub Actions to be regenerated, which takes a considerable amount of
# time.
